# onepicture
Tired of manually sorting pictures from phones, cameras and backup of backups.
Built this simple python code to look for duplicated files.
With option to remove duplicates and re-arrange by time line folders.
There might be tons of those kind of code out there, I did this to learn python and making something useful.
Hope it benifit other people.

Welcome to copy and use the code and you are more than welcome to improve it and let me know.

Please note: 
Use at your own risk! You might delete pictures by mistake in this code.
I am not responsible for any damage this might have caused.
